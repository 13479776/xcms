== NEW FEATURES ==

* Two new Peak Pickers have been integrated:
** MS1 is a pseudo peak picker, which uses the MS2 parent mass as annotated
in the mzData or mzXML files.
** MSW is a Wrapper around the MassSpecWavelet package designed for peak
picking of SELDI or FTICR single spectra
* For the alignment of individual spectra e.g. from FTICR,a fast peak
alignment has been implemented

== Experimental Features ==

* Pipeline Stuff
* There is very experimental support for Tandem MS and MSn spectra, currently 
only I/O is supported, and MSn peaks are collected in xcmsFragments objects.
* There is very experimental support for parallel peak picking using Rmpi 
and MPICH / OpenMPI / DeinoMPI. Please do not ask for support until the 
Rmpi examples work for you

== INCOMPATIBILITIES ==

* cdfpaths(xcmsSet) has been renamed to filepaths(xcmsSet)
* the default behaviour of groupval ... [Colin here]

== BUG FIXES ==

During the development of XCMS 2.0.0 all important Fixes
were backported into the 1.10.x series.
