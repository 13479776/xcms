\title{Feature alignment methods.}
\description{
The \code{groupFeatures} method(s) perform alignment of features
within and between samples. These methods are part of the modernized
\code{xcms} user interface.

The implemented feature alignment methods are:
\describe{
\item{density}{feature alignment based on time dimension feature densities.
See \code{\link{groupFeatures-density}} for more details.}

\item{mzClust}{high resolution feature alignment for single spectra (direct
infusion) MS data. See \code{\link{groupFeatures-mzClust}} for more details.}

\item{nearest}{feature alignment based on their proximity in the mz-rt space.
See \code{\link{groupFeatures-nearest}} for more details.}

}

methods.

for methods to access feature grouping results.
