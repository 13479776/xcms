\usage{
\S4method{groupval}{XCMSnExp}(object, method = c("medret", "maxint"),
  value = "index", intensity = "into")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{XCMSnExp}} object providing the feature grouping
results.}

\item{method}{\code{character} specifying the method to resolve
multi-feature mappings within the same sample, i.e. to define the
\emph{representative} feature for a feature groups in samples where more than
one feature was assigned to the feature group. If \code{"medret"}: select the
feature closest to the median retention time of the feature group.
If \code{"maxint"}: select the feature yielding the largest signal.}

\item{value}{\code{character} specifying the name of the column in
\code{features(object)} that should be returned or \code{"index"} (the
default) to return the index of the feature in the \code{features(object)}
matrix corresponding to the \emph{representative} feature for the feature
group in the respective sample.}

\item{intensity}{\code{character} specifying the name of the column in the
\code{features(objects)} matrix containing the intensity value of the
feature that should be used for the conflict resolution if
\code{method = "maxint"}.}
}
\value{
For \code{groupval}: a \code{matrix} with feature values, columns
representing samples, rows feature groups. The order of the feature groups
matches the order found in the \code{featureGroups(object)} \code{DataFrame}.
An \code{NA} is reported for feature groups without corresponding
features in the respective sample(s).
}
\description{
\code{groupval,XCMSnExp}: extract a \code{matrix} for feature
values with rows representing feature groups and columns samples. Parameter
\code{value} allows to define which column from the \code{\link{features}}
matrix should be returned. Multiple features from the same sample can be
assigned to a feature group. Parameter \code{method} allows to specify the
method to be used in such cases to chose from which of the features the value
should be returned.
