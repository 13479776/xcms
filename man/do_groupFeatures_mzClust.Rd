\title{Core API function for feature alignment using mzClust}
\usage{
do_groupFeatures_mzClust(features, sampleGroups, ppm = 20, absMz = 0,
  minFraction = 0.5, minSamples = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{A \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} with the mz values and
retention times of the identified features in all samples of an experiment.
Required columns are \code{"mz"}, \code{"rt"} and \code{"sample"}. The latter
should contain \code{numeric} values representing the index of the sample in
which the feature was found.}

\item{sampleGroups}{A vector of the same length than samples defining the
sample group assignments.}

\item{ppm}{numeric(1) representing the relative mz error for the
clustering/grouping (in parts per million).}

\item{absMz}{numeric(1) representing the absolute mz error for the clustering.}

\item{minFraction}{numeric(1) defining the minimum fraction of samples in at
least one sample group in which the features have to be present to be
considered as a feature group.}

\item{minSamples}{numeric(1) with the minimum number of samples in at least
one sample group in which the features have to be detected to be considered
as a feature group.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with elements \code{"featureGroups"} and
\code{"featureIndex"}. \code{"featureGroups"} is a \code{matrix}, each row
representing an aligned feature group and with columns:
\describe{
\item{"mzmed"}{median of the features' apex mz values.}
\item{"mzmin"}{smallest mz value of all features' apex within the feature
group.}
\item{"mzmax"}{largest mz value of all features' apex within the feature
group.}
\item{"rtmed"}{always \code{-1}.}
\item{"rtmin"}{always \code{-1}.}
\item{"rtmax"}{always \code{-1}.}
\item{"npeaks"}{the total number of features assigned to the feature group.
Note that this number can be larger than the total number of samples, since
multiple features from the same sample could be assigned to a group.}
}
\code{"featureIndex"} is a \code{list} with the indices of all features in a
feature group in the \code{features} input matrix.
}
\description{
The \code{do_groupFeatures_mzClust} function performs high
resolution alignment on single spectra samples.
