\usage{
\S4method{groupval}{XCMSnExp}(object, method = c("medret", "maxint"),
  value = "index", intensity = "into")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{XCMSnExp}} object providing the feature
definitions.}

\item{method}{\code{character} specifying the method to resolve
multi-peak mappings within the same sample, i.e. to define the
\emph{representative} peak for a feature in samples where more than
one peak was assigned to the feature. If \code{"medret"}: select the
peak closest to the median retention time of the feature.
If \code{"maxint"}: select the peak yielding the largest signal.}

\item{value}{\code{character} specifying the name of the column in
\code{chromPeaks(object)} that should be returned or \code{"index"} (the
default) to return the index of the peak in the \code{chromPeaks(object)}
matrix corresponding to the \emph{representative} peak for the feature
in the respective sample.}

\item{intensity}{\code{character} specifying the name of the column in the
\code{chromPeaks(objects)} matrix containing the intensity value of the
peak that should be used for the conflict resolution if
\code{method = "maxint"}.}
}
\value{
For \code{groupval}: a \code{matrix} with feature values, columns
representing samples, rows features. The order of the features
matches the order found in the \code{featureDefinitions(object)}
\code{DataFrame}. An \code{NA} is reported for features without corresponding
chromatographic peak in the respective sample(s).
}
\description{
\code{groupval,XCMSnExp}: extract a \code{matrix} for feature
values with rows representing features and columns samples. Parameter
\code{value} allows to define which column from the \code{\link{chromPeaks}}
matrix should be returned. Multiple chromatographic peaks from the same
sample can be assigned to a feature. Parameter \code{method} allows to
specify the method to be used in such cases to chose from which of the peaks
the value should be returned.
