\usage{
\S4method{findPeaks.matchedFilter}{xcmsRaw}(object, fwhm = 30,
  sigma = fwhm/2.3548, max = 5, snthresh = 10, step = 0.1, steps = 2,
  mzdiff = 0.8 - step * steps, index = FALSE, sleep = 0,
  scanrange = numeric())
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The \code{\linkS4class{xcmsRaw}} object on which feature detection
should be performed.}

\item{fwhm}{Numeric of length one specifying the full width at half maximum
of matched filtration gaussian model peak. Only used to calculate the actual
sigma, see below.}

\item{sigma}{Numeric of length one specifying the standard deviation (width)
of the matched filtration model peak.}

\item{max}{Numeric of length one representing the maximum number of peaks
that are expected/will be identified per slice.}

\item{snthresh}{Numeric of length one defining the signal to noise cutoff
to be used in the feature detection step.}

\item{step}{Numeric of length one specifying the width of the
bins/slices in m/z dimension.}

\item{steps}{Numeric of length one defining the number of bins to be
merged before filtration (i.e. the number of neighboring bins that will be
joined to the slice in which filtration and peak detection will be
performed).}

\item{mzdiff}{Numeric of length one defining the minimum difference
in m/z for peaks with overlapping retention times}

\item{index}{Logical specifying whether indicies should be returned instead
of values for m/z and retention times.}

\item{sleep}{(DEFUNCT). This parameter is no longer functional, as it would cause
problems in parallel processing mode.}

\item{scanrange}{Numeric vector defining the range of scans to which the original
\code{object} should be sub-setted before feature detection.}
}
\value{
A matrix, each row representing an intentified feature, with columns:
\describe{
\item{mz}{Intensity weighted mean of m/z values of the feature across scans.}
\item{mzmin}{Minimum m/z of the feature.}
\item{mzmax}{Maximum m/z of the feature.}
\item{rt}{Retention time of the feature's midpoint.}
\item{rtmin}{Minimum retention time of the feature.}
\item{rtmax}{Maximum retention time of the feature.}
\item{into}{Integrated (original) intensity of the feature.}
\item{intf}{Integrated intensity of the filtered peak.}
\item{maxo}{Maximum intensity of the feature.}
\item{maxf}{Maximum intensity of the filtered peak.}
\item{i}{Rank of feature in merged EIC (\code{<= max}).}
\item{sn}{Signal to noise ratio of the feature}
}
}
